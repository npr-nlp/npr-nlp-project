       "'looking ahead to our last day , many of our friend and colleague have been faced with a dilemma. well , how do you say goodbye ? for many of u , finding the right word can be difficult. and when inspiration fails and panic set in , well , we often turn to the long rack of greeting cards. so we ve asked former hallmark greeting card writer and creator of the youtube series greeting card emergency david elli dickerson. he ll join u in a moment. but what s the best goodbye card you ever got ? 800 989 8255. email u talknpr.org. david elli dickerson , with u here in studio 42. nice to have you back on the program . it s a lovely to be back , neal . and i have to say , broadly speaking , there seemed to be two categories. hey , congratulation , you re moving on , or , oh , i m so sorry . right , right. there s the you got fired and , you know , we re not going to see you , or you re going back to school. you re following your dreams. right. yeah . exactly. when you left hallmark , did anybody sent you a card ? oh , of course. their card ... people buy the card a week in advance , it seems like. everyone know everything beforehand. i wa also thinking another event that happens a lot when people have to say goodbye are temporary gig , like television or theater or putting together something like that , camp. and so it s an interesting challenge , because so often , the farewell card you get are thing like , it wa great working with you. we ll see you again , you know , i m looking forward to but they all seemed to miss what i love best about this new world is that there s no goodbye , you know ? i m on a road tour right now , a cross country , and i m staying with friend i ve suddenly been able to stay in touch with , 10 , 15 , 20 years. there in a way , every goodbye is temporary. and i wa hoping to see more card that would that reflect that . have you seen any ? i don t shop at card store that much anymore ... oh , really ? ... because i m in my own head . in fact , most greeting card writer don t buy greeting cards. they write their own . they write their own ? yeah. but , you know , i do know that most card store go straight into the strike zone. you know , they want the most popular kind of card , and that s generally going to be business , you know , we re sorry to see you go . or flower on the cover , and ... exactly. yes . the nice thing well , i m going to say you know , there is that category , people who are gone forever ... yes . ... but they re not going to read anymore card . exactly , exactly. in a way , you can sort of miss on a card like that. you can say whatever you want , and it s not going to matter . that actually reminds me one of the card i had in mind when i wa thinking about a card for this , would a card that would say something like in this , you know , facebook era , you know , how can you ever really say goodbye ? and on the inside , it would say something like , but if you find out how , please let me know , because i ve got stuff i need to do . it s even weirder that radio , which you think of a this ephemeral medium , that , you know , you put it on the air , it go out. you wait for the review from alpha centauri . yeah . the fact is , all of this stuff is archived on the web. all of this stuff is going to be around forever . oh , my gosh. oh , my gosh. that s amazing. well , that wa the other because my mind went to a scientific mode , a well , and i wa thinking about the fact that oh , i had one idea that said something like matter cannot be created or destroyed. every particle in our body is immortal and will survive . it is a scientific fact we will meet again. and on inside it say we ll probably have doing job , though . that s a good one . yeah , thanks . yeah. i like that one. i like that one. let s go to linda , and linda s on the line with u from longmont in colorado . hi , there . hi , linda . hello . hi , neal. i ve been on four time , five including now , and i wanted to give you one of the best goodbye card ever and just to tell you that we love , love , love you , and we ll miss you. and npr s crazy for canceling the show . oh , well , thanks. that s very kind of you to say , linda , and we appreciate that . but come on , we re going to have to demand a little more creativity from our audience than that. you got to tell u the best card you ever got , or you can write one. all right ? thank you. we love you , bye . thanks very much , linda. this is from pat who is writing u from st. louis. when i wa 15 , i began working for my hometown newspaper. my job wa vacation rotation , so i worked in every department a people took their time off. on my rotation in the business department , i had what wa up to then my most embarrassing moment. when i shut the bathroom door , the doorknob fell off on both side , locking me in. the business manager and i had to match our respective knob to free me. oh , my. i wanted to die. when i left the department a couple of week later , they gave me a farewell card , thanking me for my work. the greeting said , we ll keep a night light on in the potty for you . oh , my. she go on to say totn folk , will miss you. best wish for your future endeavors. but that s very nice . oh , that s wonderful. yes. so that s something you couldn t write a card for even if you planned it ahead of time , you know ? and that s maybe why that specific card if you ve got somebody who s creative in your department , that s really the best way to go a opposed to , you know , going down for the pre printed material . oh , absolutely. i mean , i m a big fan , of course , of greeting card company and all of that. but nowadays , particularly in a kind of post paper society , the reason you send a card is a a keepsake , a a token , a something you put on the refrigerator , a something you keep on the mantle. and so you want it to be personal , something that resonates , and the best way to do that is with a personal touch , a personal joke like the knob. that s really funny , the night light . and there is the other interesting aspect of this. so much of this turn out to be in french . oh , really . yeah. bon voyage , adieu , au revoir . oh , right . a bientot . i hadn t thought about that. you re right. that s funny. the language of diplomacy is also the language of saying so long . well , maybe they re connected. this email from gretchen in oshkosh. goodbye doesn t mean you ll be forgotten. it mean you ll be missed . oh , nice . that s not too bad . that s very nice , yeah . let s see if we go next to this is ethan. ethan with u from new albany in indiana . hi , neal . go ahead , please . yeah. enjoy your show so much . thank you . whenever i i went out to school in northern california , and i got a card from a really good friend. and the card just had a single pine tree on it , covered in snow , and it said , when you re alone , remember that you re never really alone , except you are alone , so very alone . and it kind of perfectly encapsulated what you re talking about. it wa like , there are no real goodbyes. i assume you re not going to die , so come back and don t worry about it . i like that . so very alone . it s so wonderful. it s interesting , saying there s no goodbyes. a friend of mine , i remember , just the other day posted on facebook , saying she wa having a rough day. and 20 people immediately chimed in to cheer her up , and she said , my god , that actually worked . and to me , it s amazing what just a little bit of positivity and humor can do to help you get through something . amen to that . ethan , thanks very much . thank you very much . let s see. we go next to this is john , and john s on the line with u from redding in pennsylvania . neal , you re beautiful , man. i m just going to miss you so much . thank you . but , yeah , it s great to even get on the air. so for me , the idea wa , what can i or what have i heard that really motivated me to look at this in a positive way. because when you got when they took the show off the air , i got very resentful. and clint black wrote a song called leaving a better man. and the chorus is i m leaving here a better man , having known you this way. thing i couldn t do before , now i know i can , and i m leaving here a better man. and so the whole idea wa instead of focusing on the bitterness of being rejected because the woman he loved turned him away , he just focused on what it had meant to know the person and to and how his life had changed. and so i think the idea of focusing on what wa good about the relationship is the sentiment i really will take with me . country songwriter seem to have graduated from the hallmark school . it is. actually , i once actually did a lecture on that ... really ? ... for hallmark writer country song because , right , they re doing the same thing , the same kind of structure . hmm. interesting. john , thanks very much. can you give u an example ? oh , well , it s just that like , for example , if you look at this would ve been in the 90 , so you had there were two country western song about saying goodbye. and both of them made reference to the rearview mirror. one with the rearview mirror is torn off. i m never looking back. that wa jo dee messina. and then the other i m blanking on her name had one about how i m not going to look in the mirror. so the metaphor go together , but one wa up tempo , one wa slow tempo. and so you have unintelligible one wa major key , one a minor key . different way of doing the same thing , and that s what greeting card writer have to learn how to do. how do we tell the same story again ? again and again and again . let s see. we go to suzie. suzie is with u from wilmington in the one in north carolina . that s right. thanks for taking my call. i wa going to tell you about the greatest goodbye card ever. i received a framed bus ticket. i wa leaving my first real job out of college and moving to a new city. and my group of co worker bought a bus ticket from the new city back to my old city , and they framed it. they used all my nickname when they addressed it to me. and then at the bottom , it said , in case of emergency , break glass and come home . oh . oh. that s beautiful. oh , my goodness. how long were you with those people ? well , it wa a long time ago , but it wa i haven t worked for that company in over 20 year , and i wa with them for two year so ... wow . ... it wa quite a nice send off . after 10 year , did you get an sst ticket ? well , you know , time were different then. i could crawl back faster than i could take the bus now. but , you know , that s ok . i still am curious. what industry wa that that ha that many nice people in it ? well , it wa , a you said before , creative industry , and they come up with great things. it wa a publication . nice . suzie , thank you very much for the phone call. and that s inspirational. that s inspirational . thank you . we re thank you. and we re talking with david elli dickerson , the former hallmark greeting card writer and creator of the youtube series greeting card emergency. you re listening to talk of the nation from npr news. sharon s on the line with u from reno . hello . hi. you re on the air , sharon . hello. hi. thank you so much for having me. i just wanted to say many , many thanks for year of wonderful programming. and i have , yeah , been in the middle of nevada , mapping underground. and i just wa telling your screener i have come up made it a point to always come up from underground to listen to the program to try to contribute more often than not. i ve been waiting on the line to contribute , but i m so grateful for the programming. it s gotten me through many rough days. and i m just super , super appreciative , and i m going to miss you. thank you so much and thank you for being so gracious . thank you so much , sharon . and it s been wonderful . it s very kind of you we got to work that into card , somehow . well , i wa just thinking . i wish you the best . thank you . i wa just thinking , what the previous caller had said about we are leaving a better man out. the way you ve improved people unintelligible unintelligible yes. one of the thing that s kind of nice is you , in addition to producing this program , apparently , have also increased this lady s exposure to sunlight . so melanoma , she can blame me for . no. it s ... it s a great way to go . it s the vitamin d. it s wonderful , and you don t you didn t even expect that to happen . here s an email from corineph in portland when preparing to leave china after teaching university student for three years. one of my student presented me with a small card and glass jar with some dried flower and soil from the university ground where she d studied i taught and we both lived . that s beautiful . that s really nice. let s see if we can go next to this is katie , katie on the line with u from buffalo . hi. hello . hi , katie . i m a huge fan of the show. it s so special to me that i m getting to call you today , of all day . well , thanks very much for the dialing. what s your greeting card ?

       "'this is talk of the nation. i m neal conan in washington. data from the center for disease control and prevention come to some remarkable conclusion about gun death , race , sex and region. briefly put , white people who die by gunfire are much more likely to be male , rural and suicide black people much more likely to be urban , victim of homicide and again , male . we ll explore the analysis , which wa featured in the washington post. we d also like to hear about your experiences. how ha gun violence affected you , your family and your neighborhood ? 800 989 8255. email u , talknpr.org. you can also join the conversation on our website. that s at npr.org. click on talk of the nation . later in the program , the coast guard and the northwest passage. but first gun death in america. dan keating is data editor and reporter with the washington post and join u now from studio at that newspaper. good to have you on talk of the nation today . good afternoon . and i understand of course , you re a reporter , you went through ream of statistics. but this is also your story . yes , i mean , it s something that when you look at it , white people tend to have a much greater chance of having experience in their life where they ve come up with suicide of someone they know or , you know , a relative , whereas african american are much more likely to be able to cite an example of someone they know , a relative , someone they went to school with , who suffered homicide . so it s not unusual in that regard. and in fact a i wa reporting on the story , i really hadn t thought about this before. i kind of started to jot down a list of the people i knew who had committed suicide , especially specifically with gun , and there wa a colleague and a relative and some friend dad , thing like that . and this you suggest , at least in term of people who have experience of other people in their life with gun violence , is not unusual . yes and especially the disparity is just so striking that suicide is really a white thing , a you said especially white male , and that homicide is , to such a large degree , a black thing . and give u some idea of the disparity . well , i mean , it s an interesting it s an exact mirror in term of ratio. so a white person is five time a likely to die by a suicide by gun , than by a homicide. and african american are five time a likely to die by homicide from a gun , than by suicide. so quite simply , you know , for every white person shot in a homicide , five shoot themselves and for every black person who shoot himself , five are killed by homicide . and availability of gun , well , affect both statistic . well , it s kind of interesting , because then what really drove my story wa not just the disparity in the rate , but how that applies to gun and access to guns. so the people that suffer homicide among relative , family , friend , tend to have a very anti gun attitude. and so that s prevalent in the city across all race and in the african american in both city and african american community of predominately homicide for gun death , and there s a strong urge for gun control both in the urban environment and in the african american community . but then a you move out of the city , suburb and then rural , where the gun death shift to suicide , you also shift to a much lower desire for gun control , much more support for gun rights. and so what really is interesting to me about that is that when people die in a gun homicide , the gun is vilified. the gun is blamed , and people want to stop the gun . but in gun suicide , the gun is not blamed. the gun is actually considered , you know , not the problem , and it s that , you know , they tend to more put a stigma on the person , oh there wa something wrong with him. so in the reporting on this , it wa you know , and in talking to the expert , when you go to the academic expert and those kind of people , they have a very strong conviction , and they look at the data about access to gun and suicide , and how much more suicide there is in place where there are a lot of gun . and they make a very big deal about the gun , whereas when you move actually to those place that have the high suicide rate , you hear much more that the gun is not the issue , that it s about mental health , and , you know , they really do not have a push against the gun that you get . so it s kind of an interesting disparity between the academic expert on suicide and the people that are actually in the high suicide areas. i wa kind of surprised at how big a difference there wa in that point of view . just to flip that on the other side , yes a state like wyoming , which ha a very high access to gun and a very high suicide rate , compared to a state like massachusetts , where it s more difficult to get a gun , and suicide rate are lower . about one seventh a high in massachusetts , a compared to wyoming. i mean that s a pretty amazing discrepancy because a one of the expert said , there s no reason that people with that gun owner have a higher rate of mental disorder , of mental health issues. so there really should not be a reason for there to be a higher rate of suicide . but what you get with the suicide , and this is what the expert talk about , it s not a permanent feature. it is an impulse. and if you can act on that impulse , then of course it becomes permanent. but if you can be intercepted , intervened , and , you know , with my story we ran tip about suicide prevention , then , you know , i m sorry , i don t have the exact statistic off the top of my head , i think it wa 90 percent of people who have attempted suicide and failed then did not go on to kill themselves. so that once you stop it , but especially say for instance with teenager , we have a lot of place where we have special law to prevent teenager from their own impulsiveness when it come to driving , drinking , other issue with regard to teenager . but when it come to gun , teenager with access to gun and the suicide rate there is very high and especially teenager who commit suicide almost always do it with their family s gun . we re talking with dan keating of the washington post about the epidemiology of drug of gun deaths. we want to hear about the experience in your life. how ha the gun violence affected your life , your family , your friend and your neighborhood ? 800 989 8255. email talknpr.org. we ll start with janph , and jan s on with u from buffalo , wyoming . thank you , steveph , for taking my call . it s neal , but go ahead . i m sorry. i wanted to echo what mr. keating is saying. we live in a rural community in wyoming , and for the last in the last 12 month we have had six suicide in our small community of about 5,000 people , all gender both gender , all age , all income , and the discussion about gun and access to gun it totally verboten here . everyone talk about access to mental health , rather than the access to gun being a contributing factor to these death . when we hear about gun violence in the city and how it tear neighborhood and family apart , what s been the effect of so many suicide in a small place like buffalo , wyoming ? it s very sobering. everybody know someone who ha died of a suicide. and it is something that affect our school child , it is something that affect our community. we had a prominent community member commit suicide earlier this year. and it just it just it make it very quiet around town . i can understand that. jan , thanks very much . thank you . joining u now is mark rosenberg , the president and ceo of the task force for global health , a former director of the cdc s national center for injury prevention and control. he join u by phone from his office in atlanta. good to have you with u today . thanks , neal , good to be here . and the data show that huge difference in how african american and white experience gun death. how long ha this been going on ? oh , i think this ha been going on for a long time. it s not been a secret. but i think these trend have probably been here i would say for at least 40 year . and is there any reason that you ve come up with to explain that ? i think there are lot of reason for the discrepancy. and let me talk about the suicide first and for the high rate and that because i think there s a very , very fundamental problem in the way we think about this. and one of the guest , the call in people , said that people think that it s either the gun or mental health that is the issue . and what s really important to understand is it s not either or. it s both. and if you want to make the world safe for your child , for your child who might commit suicide , then you do everything you can. it s not that you have to choose either take away access to gun from young people or get them the mental health care they want , it s both . both are part of the causal chain. and the way you interrupt the causal chain is in a many place a you possibly can , if you want to save those child s lives. there s a story that i wa told. i went to work at a school when they had a suicide , because they were afraid there might be a suicide cluster that followed the one death . and they told me that in a year previously , a young student from this school wa hell bent on suicide and killing himself. and he took his car , he drove it into a big concrete bridge at 60 mile per hour , and he walked away because he had an air bag . now it wasn t necessary to treat his depression or to stop him from being impulsive , but the air bag saved his life. if you want to save the life of our young people who are committing suicide , reducing their access to the fatal mean is just a important a giving them mental health . and a a parent or a concerned citizen , you want to make sure that they get every possible treatment that could prevent their suicide. i think people do not understand the importance of having access to the mean of suicide. so many study have demonstrated if you take the mean away , you reduce the suicide . in a lot of place , though , a gun is a tool. it s like any other tool on a ranch. you ve got to have it . and you don t let your toddler play with chainsaw . all right , stay with us. we want to hear your story , a well , those of you listening , about your experience with gun violence , whether you live in the city or in rural part of the country. how doe it change your life , your family , your town ? 800 989 8255. email u , talknpr.org. you can also join the conversation on our website. that s at npr.org. click on talk of the nation . our guest are dan keating , editor and reporter for the washington post and mark rosenberg , who is an epidemiologist and president and ceo of the task force for global health at the cdc in atlanta. stay with us. i m neal conan. it s the talk of the nation from npr news . this is talk of the nation from npr news. i m neal conan. today , we re talking about gun death , specifically an analysis of cdc data by washington post that found a clear delineation black people who die from gunfire much more likely to be shot by others white people , far more likely to shoot themselves . in addition to analysis from our guest , dan keating of the washington post and mark rosenberg of the task force for global health , we want to hear your stories. how ha gun violence affected you , your family , your neighborhood ? 800 989 8255. email talknpr.org. you can also join the conversation on our website. that s at npr.org. click on talk of the nation . here s an email that we have from bill in carrboro , north carolina i wa a teacher at a school affected by gun violence. the mother of a student wa murdered outside of our school by the estranged father of the child. he used a handgun. i saw it several of my student saw it. since this time i ve noticed that i ve become a teacher stereotype . i m obsessed with safety. i do not tolerate noise in the classroom. i expect student to do what i say when i say it and not to question it. this is not who i am in general. a an educator , i want student to converse appropriately and to question thing , yet if i d been a strict disciplinarian at the time of the shooting , i would have saved several student from seeing this awful thing . and mark rosenberg , we can t forget the ripple effect. it s not just the person who pull the trigger and the person who receives the bullet . there s a huge impact on people who grow up either in family where a suicide by gun ha occurred or in a community where someone in their family ha been shot , and the effect in term of post traumatic stress disorder , just living in high anxiety and the subsequent illness it cause , these cost are tremendous , and we re just starting to realize and appreciate those . there are also something called the cycle of violence. so a child who grows up exposed to violence becomes more likely , him or herself , to employ violence in the future. so the impact is very extensive . email question from amyph i m curious to hear whether the data for woman is significant. please , dan keating , can you help u out ? well , the rate for woman are just much lower for both homicide death and suicide death , and the discrepancy are not a great but it is still white woman are much more likely to commit suicide than black women. that pattern of suicide by white is one of the longstanding and interesting pattern , and i have never heard really a good explanation for it . so but in any event , the death rate by gun for woman are considerably lower , and unfortunately the data that we used for this , the cdc data , doe not have full event data. so for instance you cannot see when you see that a woman died of a homicide , whether , say , it wa a homicide suicide event , where someone killed her and killed themself . so that make it a little bit incomplete because in fact i would be very curious if even a few or a low a the rate of white dying from homicide is , if you were able to factor out the kind of suicide homicide , murder suicide case , that the white homicide rate would be even lower . let s see if we can go next to christineph , christine on the line with u from boulder . hi , thanks for taking my call. i wanted to just follow up on the most recent comment about the gender difference and an earlier comment about impulse control. i m a psychotherapist , and i do crisis counseling here , and boulder , larimer and routt county have some of the highest teen suicide rate in the world . and what we ve seen is that boy attempt le however , they use gun and are more successful. girl will attempt quite a bit more , but they don t use gun a often , and are more likely to survive. and the second part is that there is still such a stigma associated with the cause of death when it s suicide , that even though the kid in the community will know how someone died , there s not always a discussion in the community at large about it although i have to say in boulder we re working pretty hard and have a state suicide task force , a well . so blame the victim ? it s not so much blame the victim , it s more about protect the family because it can seem a if there wa a failure somewhere within the family system that a child would want to kill themselves , or the implication that a parent isn t good enough . and so then those kind of recrimination can echo back and forth . they can , and there s also we had a couple of year ago , it wa probably in the late 90 where we had a lot of copycat suicide , but not with guns. that wa with hanging . could i speak to the question of impulsivity ? go ahead please , mark rosenberg . i think it s really an important issue. there wa a study done of young people who had very serious suicide attempts. these are people who shot themselves , who jumped from very high height , who but for the grace of god would have died. and they asked these people how long they had considered committing suicide . there wa a very small group who had been seriously , chronically depressed and had thought about this for a very long time. but the largest percentage of young people had thought about suicide for a very short period , for many of them le than five minute . that s exactly what i see in my practice. i hospitalize a lot of kid that are suicidal , and the correlation also between poor impulse control and drug and alcohol use play a huge factor . very big , and so the suggestion is that if you can prevent them from having access to the fatal mean when they have the impulse separate the impulse from the action you can save their lives. and this is very , very important because if you have a waiting period , if people can t buy a gun right away but have to wait a week , that reduces the number of suicide . there are thing that work based on understanding the impulsive nature of suicide , especially in young people . here s a tweet to that point from riggs mack gun in the rural midwest never seemed like an issue until my 16 year old cousin made a snap decision while angry and drunk and took his own life . many of these come from anger , from intoxication and a sudden event that trigger a feeling in them that quickly will pas if only we can keep them separated from the fatal mean while they have that impulse . christine , thanks very much for the phone call . thanks for taking it . and i wanted to turn back to you , dan keating. you drew a correlation earlier that in african american community , largely in urban area , where there s a lot of homicide , there is also an attitude that it favor gun control. vice versa in rural area , where there are lot of suicide among white people. can you draw that line that because these are homicide , therefore people are in favor of gun control or because they are suicide they are opposed to it ? well , i think i think you can draw that line , and i think that the key connector in between is not blaming the gun is that and i think it s exactly what people have just been talking about in term of how the reaction in the community is suicide , the reaction is so muted. it doe ripple , it doe tear hole in a community , but it doe so quietly because people don t want to talk about it . and i think there s an amazing irony here that the medium is often accused of making a big deal about white crime victim and ignoring black crime victims. but the truth of the matter is when it come to gun crime , black crime is very much in the news , and politician campaign on crime and safety and all these kind of issue . but the white people that are you know , a lot more white people die from suicide than black people die from homicide with gun , but there s nobody campaign on suicide. nobody s making a huge outcry about it , and the vast majority of these suicide death receive no publicity and no public discussion . so the fact of the matter is these death don t generate i think people are vastly unaware of how many white people kill themselves. and there s all this discussion about what s going on in the black community with all these homicide , but you don t hear anybody saying what s going on in the white community with all these people shooting themselves . what you know , there s no good reason that we can t intervene and lower this suicide rate , but nobody s talking about it. and so nobody s making the connection between a ridiculously high rate that shouldn t be there and access to gun and issue about mental health. people aren t even making we re talking about , you know , is it one or the other or is it both ? but people aren t discussing any of it. so i think it s because people keep it a a family thing . mark rosenberg ... i would compliment dan for this story because it show that by understanding the problem , we can really figure out a way forward. and i think what dan showed beautifully in this article is that the victim are not just child in classroom who are massacred occasionally , but the victim of largest part of the victim are young black men in their community and young white men in their homes. these are big part of the gun violence problem. and i think that there s a stigma not only to people who commit suicide , but i think there s also a stigma to people who are homicide victim . and i think we stigmatize young black men who get shot. and we don t give them fair justice and fair treatment. we say , oh , these are just young black gang member and we don t think about the people who didn t belong to a gang , who were shot unintentionally , the wrong victim wa picked or they were an innocent bystander or , yes , they were involved in something , but didn t deserve to die. the stigma applies to both . here is an email that question some of our assumption here. this is from william. japan and south korea have near total gun control. i believe they are also two of the highest in suicide rates. according to data from the world health organization , south korea is number three in suicide , japan , number 11 , u.s. , 34th . that is a very it s interesting , because when you go between country , another example of it get cited a lot of time that you could find prominently on the nra website , for instance , is that russia ha very tight gun control , very few gun , but a very high suicide rate and a very high homicide rate. whereas israel , which ha very high gun possession , ha a very low suicide rate . unintelligible the same way , yeah . yeah. so when you get into the international and india ha a very high suicide rate and interestingly there it s woman , which is different than in the u.s. , and there are certainly very important cultural reason having to do with suicide with woman in india. but the thing is , when you get into the international , you start to see very big cultural difference which i do not have good explanation for . but within the united state , when you look at thing like gun possession by state , the pattern becomes very clear. so i think it s interesting that some people focus on the international where it s definitely i definitely , having looked at the data , could say you can t make a very good correlation between access to gun and homicide rate or , actually , even suicide rate. in the u.s. the pattern is much clearer . in most place around the world , firearm are not the leading cause of suicide. the most common cause of suicide worldwide is pesticides. and what happens in a country like china , frequently , young woman are upset or living in an abusive situation , and they run out against often , impulsively , and swallow pesticide that are frequently fatal. that is the most common cause of suicide in china and around the world . and it s been shown that if you can decrease access to the pesticide or if you can substitute non lethal pesticide for what are ordinarily used , the suicide rate come way down. the principle is the same if you decrease access to the lethal mean , you decrease the suicide . and we have this horribly fatalistic sense about suicide. there is nothing you can do about it. that s our biggest threat. that s what s going to get u is the sense that we can t do anything. suicide is eminently preventable. you can treat people who are depressed. you can help young people who are impulsive. it s preventable and unintelligible ... mark rosenberg is an epidemiologist and president and ceo of the task force on global health. dan keating is an editor and reporter for the washington post. you re listening to talk of the nation from npr news. and let s go to jennyph. jenny with u from reno . hi. thank you so much for this program. in 1983 , my brother who had been sick for 10 year with severe pancreatitis shot himself in my parent backyard , and they found him. he had purchased the gun two night before , and i firmly believe if his medical and psychological record could ve somehow been kept , he maybe would ve been given a second chance. i just feel the mental health care is failing u greatly here in this country. and he wa working with the va hospital and only got minimal , minimal mental health care . i m so sorry to hear this story , jenny. and it is a question that i guess we also have to turn to dan keating for , is there any correlation in the statistic with people who had or believed they had terminal illness ? well , the data that cdc ha doe not make that available. it is , you know , there are kind of age burst up in suicide and older there is kind of an age burst up for the rate among young people , but then again , among older people where , you know , a lot of people have said depression is insufficiently diagnosed and treated . and certainly there are case of people who have more longstanding issue a well a , you know , and people that have a more sudden thing. but , you know , in many of the example , a jenny said , if he could ve gotten more therapy and treatment , that would ve been a very different situation . jenny ... or if the doctor had asked about whether he ha a firearm or if he ha a gun , the doctor might have been able to intervene and , with the family s help , prevent his suicide. there are multiple thing that doctor can do , and they really need to try all of them at the same time. but asking about access to firearm by young people who are depressed or older people who are depressed is a very , very important part of practicing good medicine . here s an ... another thing that people said that i found really interesting is that that it is a good idea to ask people if they are feeling like they might hurt themself , that they could even possibly kill themself , and a lot of people would not want to ask that for fear of kind of putting an idea in their head or suggesting it. but what the expert said is if someone s not considering suicide and you ask them that question , they ll just very quickly say no , i m not thinking that. and if they are internally struggling with it , it ll be a huge relief to be able to let that out. so they said that it is a good thing to gently ask someone that you re close to if you see that kind of turmoil that make you fearful for them to ask them if they re considering hurting themself because that is actually a good way to begin to intervene . we ve put a link to dan keating s piece in the washington post at our website. go to npr.org , click on talk of the nation. dan keating , thanks very much for your time today . thank you . and mark rosenberg , thank you for joining u from the center for disease control there in atlanta . neal. i worked at the center for the disease control for 20 year but i don t work there now . i apologize . i have tremendous respect for them but i do want to not say that i m speaking for them . ok. president and ceo of the task force on global health. is that right ? that is exactly right , neal . all right. i apologize , but thanks very much for your time . thank you . when we come back , we re going to be talking about the change in global pattern of climate which is opening the arctic ocean , which mean it need to be patrolled by some u.s. force , maybe the coast guard. it s the talk of the nation from npr news. stay with u .'"

       "array(['this is talk of the nation. i m neal conan in washington. in the end , it s not close in south carolina. poll show it could be in massachusetts. and the president study up on korean culture. it s wednesday and time for a ... gangnam style ... edition of the political junkie . there you go again . when i hear your new idea , i m reminded of that ad where s the beef ? extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . senator , you re no jack kennedy . you don t have nixon to kick around anymore . lipstick . oops . but i m the decider . every wednesday , political junkie ken rudin join u to review the week in politics. in south carolina , former governor mark sanford rise from his political grave. new jersey governor chris christie becomes a smaller man. the heritage foundation tally on immigration reform draw fire from both side of the aisle. house republican ask what secretary clinton knew and when she knew it. and new poll show cuccinelli up on mcauliffe in virginia . in a few minute , we focus on iowa. tom harkin s seat is up in 2014. and it s never too early to be planning for the caucuses. later in the program , a trial s role in healing the wound from the boston marathon bombs. but first political junkie ken rudin join u here in studio 42 , and we begin a usual with a trivia question. hey ken . hi neal. well , you know , if history is any guide , ken cuccinelli will be elected governor of virginia in november , and the reason is because virginia always seems to elect governor from the opposite party of the fellow who won the white house just a year earlier. for example in 2009 , a year after barack obama wa elected president , virginia voter elected bob mcdonnell , a republican , a governor , ok. so ... so what s the question ? oh , there s more ? well , the question is when wa the last time this did not happen ? like give me the year and the name of the president . so if you think you know the answer to this week s trivia question , the year and the name of the president the last time the governor of virginia and the no , the newly elected governor of virginia wa from the same political party a the president of the united state , boy , give u a call , 800 989 8255. or email u , talknpr.org. if you can figure out the question , give u a call . you know , listener will miss these trivia question . they re going to miss these , absolutely . including you , neal . so we begin when we can with actual vote . well , i think what happened yesterday , south carolina s 1st congressional district , wa absolutely remarkable. yes it wa a republican district , it mean , it ha gone republican every year since 1980 for house. mitt romney won the seat by 18 points. and mark sanford had represented the seat for three term in congress before he wa elected twice a governor . but i think it s remarkable because every headline regarding mark sanford , you know , starting with the appalachian trail , ha been humiliating , the fact that he , you know , trespassed on his wife s in violation of his divorce decree . unintelligible , yeah . right. the democrat poured in a million dollar , democratic leaning group poured in a million , sanford wa like basically ignored by the nrcc. sanford wa walking around with a cardboard cutout , i think it wa a cardboard cutout ... of nancy pelosi . i don t think it wa actually nancy pelosi. but the point is everybody wa ridiculing that. and a public policy polling poll two week ago had colbert busch up by nine points. so for the most part everybody wa writing his obituary , a you said. so the fact that he won by nine , 59 45 , wa i think a pretty a remarkable comeback . now just one thing , everybody say well , it s a republican district , and people will over ... he won by nine. mitt romney carried that district by , what , 18 . yes , but we ve seen a lot of district , upstate new york , in the past few year where there have been scandal , and voter will say in republican district , and republican say uh uh , we re going to vote out the republican to make them pay for it. they did not make mark sanford pay for his sin . in the meantime , some commentator said that , well , how french of the voter in south carolina. they ignored the affair. mark sanford himself did not cite that precedent . i just want to acknowledge a ... ... a god not just of second chance but third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh , eighth chance because that is the reality of our shared humanity . and go ahead . i wa just going to say , but you know something , yes maybe god had something to do with it , but he out worked her. he campaigned very , very hard. and elizabeth colbert busch did not. she wa not very fluent on the issues. she did not get out and talk to the folks. sanford wa everywhere. he wa omnipresent. and she did not campaign a she could have , and perhaps she wa the wrong candidate at the wrong time . well in the meantime last night after the result were in , she thanked her volunteer . thank you so much. it s been a tremendous honor to represent you. you are the most beautiful people in the most beautiful district in the most beautiful nation. and i cannot thank you enough for taking this journey with me . and neal , i want to say you re the most beautiful host of the show . in the most beautiful studio . thank you very much. oh , i thought you were talking about me. but also tomorrow we should also point out that mark sanford is going to appear in court to deal with those trespassing charge , and i believe he ll appear in court with his ex wife jenny sanford , so a very auspicious beginning for his congressional career . a he becomes a representative elect , yes. again , in the meantime there are poll out. we re going to talk about them. there are some in , for example , place that are having election next november , including the state of new jersey , where it s not expected to be close . no , and of course a lot ha to do with the horrific event of hurricane sandy , but chris christie by most poll , there s a new nbc marist poll that show chris christie with 60 percent of the vote. the likely democratic candidate barbara buono , a state senator , with 28 percent , a landslide for a republican in a state where republican usually don t win let alone landslide . and there are also well , we should mention of course the big news in new jersey is a smaller governor . well yes , that s right. he went he underwent lap band surgery. now of course we have tried to get governor christie on talk of the nation. but now i understand he s going to go on wait wait ... don t tell me ! oh my gosh . if i use that joke one more time , you ll kill me. but look , the point is the funny thing is everybody s talking about what this mean ... because that joke wasn t funny . exactly . the fact is that everybody keep talking about what this mean for 2016 , and ... is he slimming down to improve his profile , if you will , for a presidential run ? but he had other reason , obviously . and he explained that the reason he hadn t told anybody is it wasn t anybody s business . if asked about it , i would have never lied about it , but , you know , it s not anybody else s business but mine. and so , you know , that s the reason i made the decision that i did. that s all . and it s said it s about it s not about 2016 , it s about his health , and it s about his family. his family keep asking him about his weight , and here s something he s done with it . another election next fall will be in virginia , where the a we mentioned today s trivia question , the governor s seat race seat is up . yes , and there wa a washington post poll out last week that had among likely voter ken cuccinelli , the state attorney general , the republican , had a 51 41 lead over terry mcauliffe , who ran for the nomination four year ago , former democratic national committee chairman. there s a new nbc marist poll among likely voter that came out today that had cuccinelli up by only 45 42. it s very , very close. but it s just interesting that cuccinelli ha this lead. but again i think republican are more excited about this race and more excited about cuccinelli than they are about mcauliffe. a poll this early again doesn t indicate , you know , what s going to actually happen in november . in the meantime , though , time is getting tight for the massachusetts senate seat formerly held by now secretary of state john kerry . right , and that election is june 25 , and what s interesting about that , there s a new poll also by public policy polling , which i should public policy polling , which i should say is a democratic leaning firm. but it ha ed markey , who ha been in congress since 1977 , with a 44 to 40 lead over gabriel gomez , the former navy seal , the former he s not a former hispanic , he s still an hispanic ... he s still an hispanic and probably will be for some time to come . exactly , but he also ha gomez leading among independent 47 31. do i think gomez ha a shot at it ? i guess he does. i mean , scott brown did prove that anything is possible. but this is a kind of shocking number for the democrats. but again the election isn t until june 25 . in the meantime we have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week s trivia question , the last time a newly elected governor of virginia wa of the same political party a the president of the united states. and if you know the president and the year , 800 989 8255. email u , talknpr.org. and scoutph is on the line with u and where are you in minnesota ? we re in zumbrota , minnesota. and there s a trivia question for you . yeah , i wa going to say that because i didn t know how to pronounce that. go ahead . yeah , zumbrota. it would be chuck robb in 1993 , i believe . well , the answer is not chuck robb because chuck robb wa elected governor one year after ronald reagan wa elected governor . oh , so that would have been well , the cool what president portrayed knute rockne , who wa from zumbrota , minnesota . i see. all right . that should be worth a t shirt . or maybe ... we ll try to work that in . a visit to a doctor. yeah , so ... thanks very much , scout. let s see if we can go to michaelph , and michael s on the line with u from winston salem . hello . hi , you re on the air , what s your guess ? oh good day , sir. my guest would be the president would be coolidge , i suppose , and i suppose the year would be 24 , 1924 . well , i will i can t remember who wa elected governor of virginia in 1925 ... it s silent ken . silent cal ken. but i will tell you that it s the answer is much more recent than that . oh , so i m way too far back. well , thanks anyway , gentleman , appreciate it . thank you , we always like those coolidge ... not enough coolidge . let s see if we can go next to tomph , and tom s on the line with u from naples , florida . hi , 1969 , nixon wa the president . nixon wa the president , and a you well remember , linwood holton , also a republican , wa elected in 1969. but that wa not the most recent time it happened . ooh , very good call , tom . not worth a ... no , not worth a t shirt , you ve got to get the year . all right , listen , you gave me my 15 second second of fame. i appreciate that . all right , thank you. and let s see if we can go next to this is steveph , and steve s on the line with u from little rock . wa it mill godwin , who had switched party , i believe , in 73 , nixon wa president ? now that is the correct answer . ding ding ding . we did have the right president , richard nixon , but it wa his second term. nixon wa re elected in 72. mill godwin ... and we have two t shirt going out this week because joseph powersph of san francisco came in with that answer on email . and mill godwin of course a democrat who wa elected a a democrat , by the way , in 65 then elected a a republican in 73. there is not there is no such thing a too much trivia on talk of the nation . stay on the line , steve , we ll collect your particular and send you out that political junkie t shirt for free and of course the fabulous no prize button and in exchange for a promise of yourself wearing said product in a digital image that we can post on our wall of shame. ok ... neal , do you realize that when we go off the air you and i will be stuck with 8,000 of these t shirt ? but we ll just walk around ... start handing them out. it s going to be in the meantime , we just have a few second left in this segment , ken , but interesting response by the senate majority leader harry reid to the anti gun ad being run by the mayor of new york . well here it is. i mean of course we know that the republican the anti gun folk the pro gun i m sorry , the anti gun folk are trying to target republican like kelly ayotte and jeff flake and thing like that. but when michael bloomberg s group go after democrat like mary landrieu and heidi heitkamp in north dakota , that s too much for the senate majority leader from nevada . and are they going to stop ? they re not. bloomberg said uh uh , look , they voted against the gun law , we re going to go after them . ok , ken , stay with us. when we come back , we re going to be focusing on iowa , which ha an open senate race in two year , or i guess a year and a half or so , and we re already talking about 2016. i m neal conan. it s the talk of the nation from npr news . this is talk of the nation. i m neal conan. it s wednesday , which mean political junkie ken rudin is with us. and ken , scuttlebutton winner from last week ? there absolutely is. i m so glad you asked me that. there wa actually a very interesting puzzle , in my humble opinion. the first button wa a feinstein for vice president. second button wa a perot for president. and then in three button in a horizontal line , vote no on john robert , impeach earl warren , and stop david souter. so when you have feinstein for vice president , perot for president , and those three judge button , do you have diane ross and the supremes . i see . yes , and the winner wa kelly cherry leahph of washington , d.c . who need more to do with her time . we all do . new puzzle up ? the new puzzle will be up a soon a this show is over today . today . today , and the new column is up , yes . ok , and you can find both of those , go to npr.orgjunkie. last friday , vice president joe biden addressed fellow democrat in columbia , south carolina. across town , republican senator ted cruz spoke to republicans. the two high profile appearance in the early primary state fueled speculation about 2016 . when drafting a short list of possible contender , some look to iowa , home of the first electoral test for anyone seeking the white house. today we ll talk with leader from both party in that state , first a.j. spiker , chairman of the iowa republican party. he join u from iowa public radio in de moines. nice to have you on talk of the nation today . a.j. spiker yeah , thank you for having me . and before we get to the presidential possibility , you re still looking for senate possibility . that s correct. we ve got an open senate seat here , and the republican party is looking at a pretty contentious primary . well , there s been any number of prominent republican there who said , well , we re just going to sit this one out . that happens from time to time. people , for whatever reason , decide to stay in their current job. we have several statewide elected republican that are very happy staying , working in the state of iowa . ken ? well , you know , what s strange , a.j. , about this is that , you know , in the past when tom harkin ha run , the republican party ha recruited very good , seemingly very good republican candidate , mostly house members. but now everybody , everybody of prominence , the lieutenant governor , congressman steve king , congressman tom latham , even governor terry branstad , they all said no . and this is an open senate seat , usually which is the easiest to win a opposed to running against an incumbent. what s going on ? well , like i said , i think tom latham and steve king , both congressman , are very happy continuing to work within their congressional districts. and we have statewide elected republican who really love the state of iowa and who want to continue to work within the state. so you ll see a very big field probably emerge within the republican party . i expect people with high name recognition will enter the race , and you ll see republican unite around the winner of the primary , and we ll be ready to win in the fall . a we ve seen in massachusetts , a relative unknown can suddenly rise to prominence very quickly and make it a competitive race. but i wanted to get off to the rumbling about 2016 , the early polling , and it is very early , show that marco rubio is among the favorite . yes , marco rubio is popular in iowa , with iowa republicans. he wa here last fall and did an event for the governor s birthday party . do you think that his prominence in the immigration reform push might hurt him among the republican party faithful who are , well , in iowa decidedly conservative ? republican are very united around the idea that the first thing we need to do is secure the border. and then after that , you know , there s really within the party some room for debate on where the next step is. and i think whether it s marco rubio or another potential candidate coming to iowa for 2016 , they re going to make their case to iowan . iowan are very open and will listen to whatever their position are and what they have done for voting in the past , and they ll vote their conscience in the caucus . ken ? you know , of course a lot of people around the country say i can t believe we re talking about 2016 because after all , we are many year away from that. but we do know that folk in iowa do pay attention earlier than anybody else because candidate , would be candidate , come into the state earlier than anybody else. is there anybody we mentioned marco rubio , but is there anybody else getting especially good buzz ? well , we re having united state senator rand paul here this friday. he ll be keynoting the republican party of iowa s lincoln dinner in cedar rapid , iowa. and that event sold out about two week before the date of the event. so that s obviously been a good event for u to be pushing and a sign of some interest in senator paul after his 13 hour filibuster . the some republican party around the country have shown this battle between the establishment and the so called ron paul wing of the party. is iowa going in that ... well , iowa ha several faction within the party , just like every state. i supported congressman paul in 2008 and 2012. i wa nominated in 2012 to be the chairman of the party by a santorum supporter who wa the head of the iowa right to life in the past. and in 2013 i wa nominated by steve scheffler , who s the head of the iowa faith and freedom coalition , a ralph reed entity . so , you know , i think there s a lot of unity around principle of the party. we re going to have some difference on candidate from time to time. but republican a a whole are pretty united on issue . are you united on procedure ? there wa a lot of criticism after the last presidential election about too many debates. the iowa straw poll wa seen a a distraction by some . and the caucus itself , which we didn t know that santorum won until much later . and so are you going to change procedure at all ? oh , i think you ll see some procedure changes. the rnc is currently looking at scaling back the number of debates. but that s going to be very political also because , you know , some candidate are going to want fewer debate , some candidate are going to want more debate . a far a the ames straw poll , that s always an item that the marketplace decides if we have a straw poll. if the candidate want it , it occurs if they don t , it doesn t occur. so you know , i really see , you know , pretty good possibility for 2015 , 2016 . can i ask you a question also ? there s always been the criticism about iowa that you have to run republican need to run so far to the right to get the vote the steve schefflers and the pro family group are in iowa. and yet a we saw , mitt romney in 2012 desperately try to move towards the center , to the middle , in the general election. do you feel that s a fair criticism of the situation in the way of you have to get the republican nomination ? no , i don t think that s a fair criticism at all , because if you look at ron paul and mitt romney , those two candidate were arguably , you know , not embraced by social conservative to a large degree. and between the two of them , they would have pulled in 45 percent of the caucus vote. so you know , i don t think that s necessarily a fair statement . well , thanks very much for being with u today . absolutely , thanks for having me . a.j. spiker , chairman of the iowa republican party , joined u from the studio of iowa public radio in de moines. we re trying to get tyler olson , the chairman of the democratic iowa party , on the the iowa democrat on the line. he s not answering his phone right now. but a soon a he doe , we ll get him on the line . in the meantime , some other item that we need to talk about , ken. we talked about senate race in massachusetts. there s interesting development in the senate race in georgia . well , yeah , just like the republican are having trouble finding a candidate in iowa , the democrat are having trouble finding a candidate in georgia. the big announcement this week is john barrow , the blue dog democrat who is always targeted by the republican because he s so conservative in a conservative district he announced this week he will not run for the senate seat that republican saxby chambliss is giving up . so while the democrat are looking for a candidate in georgia , the republican have too many almost. you have three member of the house paul brown , phil gingrey and now jack kingston in the race. others may get into it. so while the democrat are searching for a candidate , republican are going to have a very tough primary . and there are and that wa the democrat , he wa thought to be their best hope in that . absolutely , the best choice. now they re looking at sam nunn s daughter , actually , a a possible candidate . and there are rumbling about the senate seat in alaska , where there is what s perceived to be a vulnerable democrat . well , that s mark begich , of course , who voted against the gun bill , which may be popular in alaska . that vote may be popular , but ... right , but anyway , the democrat the republican , there s a tea party group that s saying sarah palin , please run they want her to run. i guess she did so well a a half term a governor , maybe should could be a half termer senator. that s a snarky thing to say , i apologize . sean parnell , who wa the governor of alaska , some who succeeded sarah palin a governor some republican would love for him to run. but he announced today , this week , that he will run for re election a governor. joe miller , the republican who beat lisa murkowski in the primary but then wound up losing to her , who ran a a write in , joe miller is in that race . mark begich is a popular guy , but it s still alaska , which is very strongly republican. it ll be a tough race for begich . in the meantime , tyler olson is ready to join u now , he s the chairman of the iowa democratic party. he s with u by phone from the state capital , de moines. good to have you with u . thank you. good afternoon . and a we were talking earlier with your republican counterpart , we ll start with the senate race , and the democrat have a very different situation , a opposed to an entirely open field. the party seems to have already coalesced around one candidate . well , congressman braley is out and running. he ha really been a champion for iowa in the house for the last few years. he s really stood up for iowa value , the middle class and expanding health care , and people have responded to that message. and he s off to a great start . and do you expect that he will attract a rival in the primary ? i don t think so. he is already out working , ha visited a number of counties. he ha reported a million dollar cash on hand , and he is working to solidify the primary voter and move forward to make sure that we re successful in 2014 . ken ? tyler , i can t ask you to get into the head of republican , but how come the republican were very eager to run against tom harkin , who won all those term , and yet with an open seat , there were no republican of note running , at least a of yet ? why do you think that is ? well , i think a lot of it ha to do with congressman braley s strengths. you know , a i said , he served in congress for a number of year and ha really stood for the same value that senator harkin ha spent his career fighting for . yeah , but they ran but the republican ran against harkin time and time again , with good candidates. they re not doing it this time. i m just wondering if you have any idea why that may be the case . well , i don t , really. i mean , i think that , obviously , senator harkin , his announcement , i think , surprised some folk and but i really think a lot of it ha to do with kind of the way that iowa ha moved over the past couple of election cycles. president obama wa won the state handily. and we ve really moved towards an electorate that understands that the value that senator harkin fought for and now that congress braley fight for will fight for are the one that will move our country in the right direction . iowa traditionally is seen a a swing state. are you ready to paint the state blue ? well , i m working night and day to make sure that that happens , absolutely. you know , we at the party have a great base to jump off of because of 2012 and the organization that the president s reelection campaign put together. we re hard at work cementing that organization in. we have hired a field director earlier than the average cycle , and already contacting all of those neighborhood team leader , so that even though it s a nonpresidential year , you know , we re going to make sure that those folk are out organizing their neighborhood and community so that our candidate in 2014 are successful . tyler olson , chairman of the iowa democratic party. it s wednesday. of course , political junkie ken rudin is with us. and you re listening to talk of the nation , from npr news. and thought of 2016 , of course , turned to the leading two democrats. is there iowan expressing any preference thus far ? well , the two leading democrat , of course , the former secretary of state hillary clinton , vice president joe biden. is anybody else in any people s thought ? well , i think there are , obviously , a number of folk that are interested , and i m sure will be visiting the state over the next couple of years. iowa is a state in the presidential caucus process that value one to one contact. candidate come here. they meet folk in their living rooms. they go to the community center and want to ask questions. and so secretary clinton and vice president biden both have obviously had those network in the past and have worked on those network in the past . and i know that , you know , supporter of each are awaiting their announcement. and so i think , you know , we ll see we ll start to see some activity here. we obviously have an open senate race at the top of the ticket. we have a governor s race up in 2014 , and control of the iowa house and senate are both relatively close. and so i think candidate that are interested in evaluating their option for 2016 are going to see work on each of those race a important to getting a head start on their chance in the presidential year . well , tyler olson , thanks very much for your time today. we appreciate it . i appreciate it. thank you . tyler olson , chairman of the iowa democratic party. he joined u by phone from de moines. and , ken , before we leave , 2016 , one of those possible candidate , secretary of state hillary clinton , is getting beaten up a little today in front at the house of representatives. she s not there in person , but she s being called to task for what happened in benghazi . exactly. this is the house oversight committee that s having it hearing today. now , the republican want to embarrass the obama administration. do they want to hurt hillary clinton in advance of 2016 ? without any question. but there seems to be question that that have been raised at today s hearings. gregory hick , who wa the deputy chief of mission there when ambassador stevens wa killed , the others were killed , he s been a career diplomat for 22 year . yes , this is a republican issue that they love to beat over , you know , beat over , but hick is asking very serious question about what the administration might have been able to do to prevent this tragedy , what couldn t they have done , and these are question that ultimately will demand answer from the white house , and perhaps from hillary clinton herself . and some expect subpoena for people like hillary clinton . yeah. i mean , look , a i said , the republican are looking to make this political hay of it , and i understand that. but there are still some question that need to be asked. and gregory hick is the perfect guy for them , because this guy is not a fox commentator. this guy is not darrell issa or a conservative member of congress. this guy doe not have an ideological bone to pick with the obama administration. he just seems to have these legitimate question that need to be answered . in the meantime , yesterday , delaware became the 11th state in the union to legalize same sex marriage , and the news is there wa a yawn . well , look , the point is is that one year ago tomorrow is
